Microfern is a minimal templating engine for JavaScript & TypeScript that works
in browsers ([Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/),
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and derivatives),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Edge Runtime](https://edge-runtime.vercel.app), and [Bun](https://bun.sh). There are no files, no template
inheritance, no recursion or complex operations. The template language is
inspired by [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks), and should be easy
for anyone to write.

The whole thing fits within 100 lines of code, and has no dependencies. Add templating support to your project without inflating your bundle size!
