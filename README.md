Microfern is a minimal templating engine for JavaScript & TypeScript that works both in browsers and Node. There are no files, no template inheritance, no recursion or complex operations. The template language is inspired by [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks), and should be easy for anyone to write.

The whole thing fits within 100 lines of code, and has no dependencies. Add templating support to your project without inflating your bundle size!
